            <p>
              Geek Appointment is a web platform designed for students to book
              appointments with faculty members of the Department of Computer
              Science & Engineering at Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering &
              Technology, Longowal. Our goal is to streamline communication
              between students and faculty, making it easier to seek guidance
              and support.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              To book an appointment, simply visit our website, select the
              faculty member you wish to meet, choose a suitable time slot from
              their available schedule, and submit your request. You will
              receive a confirmation once your appointment is approved.

          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              The Geek Appointment project has been developed by a dedicated
              team of students: Ansh Bansal, Arjun Gupta, Adarsh Sharma, and
              Aakansha. Their combined efforts have brought this innovative
              solution to life.

          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Currently, students can book up to three appointments per week to
              ensure everyone has a fair opportunity to connect with faculty. If
              you require more time, please discuss it directly with the faculty
              member.

              If you need to cancel your appointment, please do so at least 24
              hours in advance. You can easily cancel your appointment through

              the faculty member and the student. You can specify your
              preference when booking.
